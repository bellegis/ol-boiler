# OpenLayers boilerplate template
This is a boilerplate template for building an OpenLayers web app. It contains a directory setup and displays a basic web map. 

## Get started
To download the dependencies this project needs, open a new terminal at this folder and run `npm install`.

To view a working copy locally, run `npm start`, and type URL `localhost:1234` into a web browser.

To make changes, edit the html, css, and javascript versions of files found in the **src** folder.

Files in the **dist** folder have strange names, but those files are the distribution version of your website, once you're ready to host it somewhere.
